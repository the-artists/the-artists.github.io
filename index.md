# About QuestBoards

## Goals
* Create a simple method for users to get paid to do short term jobs.
* Make it easier to delegate small, tedious tasks. 
* Connect users through job board listings (Quests).
* Define a status for jobs (open, pending, closed) to signify job availability. 
* Users can access their profile to see their associated quests.

## Future Goals
After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:

* Rating system for users in terms of reliability and job satisfaction.
* See previous job completion history
* Suggest other users for job
* Push notifications
* Venmo/Apple Pay support

## Mockups
* Job Board, a listing board for all available quests:

* Job Create, page to create listing for quest. Should include pay, title, deadline, description, location, contact information, and skills/resources required:
